A neutron star rotates with a tangential velocity almost a quarter the speed of light.

Are violent events in the universe reflected down onto earth? Competition in nature. Massive bodies with followers worshiping their cruelty.

In all things I try to harmonise my desires for compassion and decisiveness. The idolatry of important men must exist outside this binary. There is nothing decisive about corrupted power. A will imposed on every circumstance is not leadership, it is something broken.

I hitched a ride here on a solar wind. I'm reading a wonderful book about the transformative power of vulnerability in friendships. I want to be vulnerable to you like the ejection of mass shared between neighbouring galaxies.
