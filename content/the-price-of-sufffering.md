Do you ever fear the things that happened to those that came before? Do you ever calculate the price of suffering that was paid to bring you into the world?
I want to imagine my forebears happy, absorbed in their lives like animals guided by voices we no longer hear.
Perhaps the women loved their children and felt blessed to take part in creation. Perhaps they were neither slave nor property, at peace with their role in handing down the lineage, and I’m needlessly projecting my fears onto them.

I’m harassed by dreams of the peace I felt in childhood.
What was it all for?
Am I worth the plastic in the ocean, the carbon in the air? Am I one of the superfluous lives propped up by ammonia fertilisers? 

I want to look up at the night sky and see a love note written in the stars.
