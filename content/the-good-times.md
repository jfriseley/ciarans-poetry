My neighbour said "remember the good times and move on". Just as I was cementing my perception of her in the worst moments of our time together, just as I was congealing a screenshot of the twilight hours of our relationship.

You ask too much of me. I want to add the pain to my collection. I want to plant a seed in the garden of my hurt.

I told my friend recently that your feelings are designed to protect you. I'm not sure why I said it and I don't know if it's true.

What information could I possibly add to my model of the world? That it starts out wonderful and turns to hell? That you have no reason to trust people, really?

That with the right person it will feel right? That could be the lie of conflating what you want with what you think you need.

He asked if we are going to be friends. I just told my best friend she is dead to me. 

I ran into a school friend who made me laugh hysterically just as the walls were closing in.

Do you ever feel you are being mocked by the kindness of strangers?
