I have at times been hard on you in my attempts to help you. I can only trust that honesty is welcomed in our friendship, even an expression of my feelings that doesnt quite get expressed in the simplest way.

I am trying to find the line in life, in all things. The line between open mindendess and judgment, the line between helping and rescuing, the line between compassion and smothering.

I was crying because I have the feeling that I am walking a tenuous rope while all around the stars are going out.

I have precious few examples of love. So few that I do not really trust my ability to recognise it.

So many people lately have become as though possessed when I confront them with my perception. Demons almost.

And while you have perhaps gotten mad at me, and asked me to change my behaviour, I have never witnessed this strange rage in you.

You sometimes bring me an idea or a thought at a poignant moment. I hope there is meaning behind all of these observations of mine.

I hope there is meaning behind all of these observations of mine.

Sweet dreams, my friend.
