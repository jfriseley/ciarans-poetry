“Women only say they want independence until they need help”.

I have been desperate for my independence for so fucking long. Never thought I would work full time. Didn’t think I’d ever get hired somewhere so I can hear sexist bullshit from someone in a position of power over me.

I’m shaking with anger when I tell my friends what he said. I want to show him the compassion that perhaps others have not, explain how it made me feel. But I don’t fucking want to be vulnerable like that with someone when I’m this upset.

There is no shame in needing help. Everyone deserves independence if they want it, and relying on those around you does not make you any less independent. The prejudices you form instead of processing your grief will not protect you from getting hurt again.
