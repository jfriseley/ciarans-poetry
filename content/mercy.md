For a decade I refused to eat meat. When I broke my vows my pulse quickened. My whole body was flushed with blood as my teeth sank into the flesh.

Do you think carnivores feel guilt? I saw a video once of a lion who adopted the baby of an animal it had killed. The baby couldn't survive without its mother.

The other day my girlfriend found me sitting by a lit candle, dripping with tears. I told her I had a minor question about the purpose of suffering.

I tell people I wasn't a good fit in big tech. None of the words mattered. It was all a negotiation of status. 

I say I'm happy at work now. Is that true or am I just the predator here? I'm more massive and more cruel, and the other monsters are fascinating.

I still eat vegan food most of the time, because when the hunger subsides I can't live with myself. We made domestic animals in our image.

I'm not sure how to be kind anymore. I don't want to do for other people what they can do for themselves. 

I don't give money to panhandlers anymore. That's not true, I gave a gift card to someone who didn't ask. Maybe she used it to buy one of the many over the counter pills for trauma. 

I couldn't hack it in big tech because I was afraid of everyone. Does she feel that way everywhere? Is every person on the street a shark to her, a machine programmed to devour?

I don't have time for people anymore. I'm not here on earth to listen to people talk about their  problems.

That's not true either. All I do is listen. 

Fuck being kind. I'd rather be merciful. 

My girlfriend adopted a thirteen year old cat from the pound. He has arthritis and he always meows at me as if to say it hurts. I know. I give him a pat and tell him he's a big old man.

The pound gave us blankets and toys. The volunteer was quite anxious to ensure he would be a good fit in our home.

I have a photo of my girlfriend's cat, sitting in his bed, with his eyes closed. 

I don't think nature designed us to be merciful. 

When I'm an old animal will you let me live out my days in peace?
