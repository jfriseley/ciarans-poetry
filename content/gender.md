My partner is sick of hearing me talk about gender. 

"I have a male brain" I say. "Look, it can do math! It can rotate shapes!" I guess all those other women in engineering school had male brains too. I hope someone tells them.

Someday they'll finally look at my chromosomes and tell me I'm not a woman. Thank God. All I want is to be medically non-binary.

I promise I've felt this way since I was a child. Yes, I know women can be like this too. 
It's different.
How?
It's a whole constellation of things.
It's hard to explain.

Not good enough.
The space you are asking for requires the violence of its creation.
Would you send a runner into the enemy camp with a draft of your demands?

I consecrate myself to my own plausibility. I cordon off parts of me.

The timing of the sadness that took hold, right as my body started to change -- It can't all be a coincidence. I must be able to make sense of all of this.

"I think I have two genders" I say. "One of them is my fuck you gender" 

I have said something completely unhinged and they respond with "that is so valid".

I've had enough of people doing their best to support me. 

I don't fucking want to be valid. I want to bump up against something so I know where the fucking walls are.

Why are you so obsessed with facts? It's because I don't trust the way I feel. 

I don't trust my feelings in any of this. I'm terrified that the world inside me might be of my own creating.

You beautiful thing, would that be so bad? There are parts of you that you can't see by looking. They don't like to be interrogated and they won't tolerate being reduced to numbers.

No, I can figure it out, I can figure all of this out. We need it to make sense. 

Language is too terse, music too linear, paintings too still to describe you. 

We won't change their minds like this.

You're wonderful like a secret. You still surprise me.

Stop. I can explain. All of this can be explained.

I can't explain why the feelings come and go.

I can't explain how much of this resides in me and how much is at the interface with other people.

All those Socratic dialogues and no answers. I can't defend myself against reduction to absurdity and I don't know where this lives in my DNA.

You never had to justify yourself. You never had to change anyone's mind. 

I want to smell of sandalwood and tobacco. I'm addicted to Youtube videos about men's style.

Someone at a party asked me about my skincare routine, and I said that when my face feels dry I use water. My friend laughed and laughed and called me a transmasc icon.

I like kids but I don't want to be anyone's mum.  I have mistreated my feminine side and I want to repair things.

I hope you find that your story makes sense from start to finish.
