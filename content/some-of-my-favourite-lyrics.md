I've heard that Julian Casablancas writes all his music for piano before transcribing it for his band. 
And he's right you know, you do belong on the radio. Kids are honest, that's true. And I agree with that playful counterpoint, and the melody that sounds like lights.

My family was asleep but I was awake. I crept down the stairs of the hotel room to look in the mirror.

Sometimes I even use my lungs for breathing.
I think if he returned there's a good chance we would kill him twice.
Underoath used to dedicate every show to Jesus. I wonder what happened to them that shook their faith.

I bought Define the Great Line in Canberra. My violin teacher was performing and he brought me along as a babysitter for his baby and toddler. I was surprised to find that I had no compassion for the baby. Her breath smelled bad and she just looked up at me in fear as she screamed.

As Cities Burn, the saddest Christian band. Indie rock on a post hardcore label. No screaming, just the sound of the whole ocean.
She will become my new sun. But she really shouldn't. Kid, I know how much you want this. You've been denied something you need and now there's a fucking thicket inside you. But they're gonna fuck with you, kid. I'm sorry you were sent out there to make sense of it all on your own.

I was in love with my friend and I couldn't tell her. I had exams. How much pressure is the right amount of pressure to place on a child?

Brand New. Don't play with embers near dried out pines. I've tried. I've tried. I've tried to put my hands to work. Imagine if the work could just be done. Do you ever wish it were all complete?

I went for long walks along Swann Road and dreamed of doing something more. Once I wanted to be a scientist so I could get paid to tell the truth. I guess I was yet to discover that results could be falsified. The end of the song goes like this: "it was a good dream"

There's something so kind about Sophie's music. But don't tell me I'm lost. What do you know about me? I'm fine, I don't want your shitty fucking help. I'll figure it out myself. (So said the lost). Sophie had somehow written music about patience. She somehow had analogue synths like bubblegum and whiplash. I hope they find you and I hope they make you feel better. 

My Sophie was and probably always will be the smartest person I have ever met. She made the most incredible connections between disparate topics. She mastered whole fields without stepping foot in them.

No, I'm not telling you who this is, my reputation as an artist couldn't take it. Sorry. I'm on the fence about sorry. It's good to apologise. But is it good to feel guilt? Baby. No, don't. I don't want to hear it. He has a beautiful voice. Leave me alone. I hope you find something holy in other people, and I hope you make it to the water beneath the parting clouds.
