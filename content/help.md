I didn't come for the well, I came for the sick.

A nice idea for God. But if you're a person, maybe you just have a messianic complex.

When I signed up to volunteer they told me you have to be aware of your own reasons for wanting to do this. Carers tend to be rescuers, she told me.

I'm not here to rescue anyone. I have a friend I'm trying to get some space from. He never has anything good to say and it's getting me down.

Okay, it's actually a couple of friends. I get anxious about one of my friends meeting people because I never know when she's going to get shitty about something. She told me she wasn't doing too well, but I don't think I can help her. She's been inconsiderate too many times.

There is a friend I do want to keep around. She always asks about you. At a restaurant? Do you like the food. Never met you before? What do you do for work. She told a story once about a relative who accidentally wound up in Caboolture as a backpacker, and his mate was going to give him the bed and sleep on the floor. She told us this like she was pleading with us not to do it.

I got really stressed before going on exchange. I told my mum that I'm afraid I'll get into trouble and no one will help me.

I did get yelled at for moseying around in the dead of winter. A guy came running out of his house and threatened to call the police.

I once saw a woman having a nervous breakdown at Coles. I put down my gym bag and sat on the floor with her and got her talking. She told me about something minor that happened to her and how it ruined her day. You don't want that, I said. You're just trying to live your life. There was a security guard but he didn't kick her out, he brought her a bottle of water. 

Be careful. Is it help that you need? Or is someone depriving you of an opportunity to learn something?

I found a lot of peace when I stopped trying to help people with my career. I do something now that's in demand and they pay me for it. But don't let me stop you, I would love to see you try.

I don't think I can have kids. How can I help someone every single day for 18 years? I'm so scared I would fuck it up.
