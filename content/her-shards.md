Is my soulmate in splinters? Am I chasing her shards?

Not for me to know. And turning the mirror on myself, I find it cracked. Perhaps I'm as much a shard as she is. Perhaps she has been searching for the traces of me in countless lives, collecting them in her grief and cutting her fingers on the edges.

The origins of this fatigue - is it the animal who never returned to safety? Or is it the soul in communion with something that does not fit?

Weariness has me on the retreat. All the people I meet of late are ghosts, circling around my halo of empty space. 

Hope feels like a provocation, a vein of something red and hot that cracks my mantle. I fend it off but it's already under my skin, and the pain of hope has me reckoning with the past. It's a lesson that I do not want, not right now, not in my solitude, not as I calcify into myself, dream of knitting all the splinters together and shattering in reverse. 

The longing doesn't go away. You have made a lot of mistakes. Stop abandoning yourself. Do not give up.
