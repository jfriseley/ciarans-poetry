It's time to add to your collection of trite bullshit. And the more time you waste, the blander the aphorism you get when you cash out.

Ah, if only I had loved myself! And not been so desperate, and surrounded myself with friends. 

I'm gearing up to tell people that I don't want to date anymore, that I'm going to take my medicine at last, be single, overcome my need for romance, and discover love when I least expect it, in some revolting meet cute that we will brag about with our hands clasped.

Whenever I say it I want to tell myself to fuck off. 

How dare you deny the ache you feel in your heart. It's not disappointment or grief. It's not loneliness. It's not some moral shortcoming. It's not weakness, it's not a lack of friendship or meaning or something you have failed to achieve or some fucking lesson you have yet to learn.

There is no lesson in desiring to be seen, no substitute for being known. The lack of your other half stings as much now as it did before; personal growth does not dull it, though I hope it would make you more patient.
