Since I came of age I have been accompanied by a vision of two lights in a helical orbit.

I am so fucking frustrated. I'm scared that every person I have ever loved is a shard. I'm afraid that my sister flame is abiding in heaven and I'm cursed to chase her fragments in an endless cycle down here in the fucking mud.

I get a type of sickness when certain people draw near to me. This time, I always think, I'll get it in one.

How many fucking chances do I have to get it in one? One, two, three, more than I can bear to count. 

I feel unclean. But what was the point of it all? What was the point of saving myself for someone who is nothing but splinters and dust?

I console myself with the work of my hands. Maybe someday it will all be complete.
