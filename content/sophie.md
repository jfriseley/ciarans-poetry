I need to stop recommending Diana Wynne Jones to people.

I'm with her initially - a caring and unobtrusive girl with hidden magic, stuffed into the bowels of a shop by her family, stifled and exploited, until she flees in poverty.

Sophie is undoubtedly the heroine, though for some reason people think the story is about the beautiful wizard. Howl is depicted as more otherworldly in the film; in the book, more histrionic. In the film he cooks breakfast only to feed it to the fire without eating it, like a marble statue, Adonis in a diamond patchwork cape.

The book and the film converge on one scene: a tantrum. Rage at Sophie for inadvertently touching some of his things in the course of her duties as a domestic servant.

The film takes a liberty only hinted at in the sequel: that the story is a romance. That Sophie married the realm's handsomest and richest dandy. The book credits her cunning and resourcefulness. The film, Howl perceiving her latent magic, and falling to his knees before the only woman to witness his monstrosity.

I hope that in whatever world these stories are set, Sophie is proud of herself, and doesn't question what options she might have had if she had not been betrayed by her caregivers.
