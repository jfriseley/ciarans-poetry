I dreamed of salvaging something from the wreckage.
The first signal was the aggression - the fear in his eyes that caught on to anger, approaching me past the invisible wall, like a starved animal, the shove.

I took it as a sign to renegotiate. This living arrangement won’t suit now. We sleep too close together. He had already touched my things? I grasped at the world around me as the black knots of fear clouded my vision.

I went to the person whose job it was to help me, and in a perversion of their role as a leader and teacher, I saw the same thing in their eyes, the same homing into my space, seeking me out like a target for their ailments, something to blame and destroy.
The hierarchy is ravaged. The covenant broken. It was your job to protect me and I am now enacting a rite of passage because my brain is telling me there are no other options.

I withdraw. Calculate. I try to determine what I need. What few precious personal items could I carry with me in flight?
I inspect all the skateboards I have been collecting and write off the effort required. I linger on one - it meant something to me. 
All I take with me is a mug, a fine bone china mug,  with a gently flared rim, white with silver filigree. It glows in my hands a little.

I awaken in the morning and my girlfriend - are we calling it that? - tells me she is comforting herself after a nightmare. I put my phone down after hitting up numerous besties. One of my friends is accustomed to the stories I send her in the small hours. I read them back as the kettle boils. 

Communications just broke down with a friend. I told him I didn’t like him thinking he knows what’s best for me - or rather, that is how it seems to me. I think he might have just been worried. But I have fucking had enough of people telling me how the fuck to live my life while dissimulating their own anxiety.

Reading back what I said it all seems textbook to me. This upset me. Please don’t do it. Here is how it relates to my unmet needs in friendship. I love you and care about you. And in my weakness, an olive branch - “I understand tempers can flare when someone is being assertive”.

He isn’t speaking to me. Obsessed over his perception that I claimed to know his mental state. Trapped in a sidequest. Admitted he was worried about me but didn’t want to elaborate (or perhaps couldn’t). In my rant to my trusted friend I used a vulgar analogy for refusing to humour people anymore who are doing things I don’t like: I know it would have been better in person but it shouldn’t be that complicated and I’m not here to cup anyone’s balls.

I told my friend I feel damned in every possible scenario. That if I had been less blunt, less straightforward, given him less credit to trust me and take what I say at face value, manufactured some ball-cupping tone of voice, he would have gotten upset too.

I considered the teacup I had my tea in. It is my favourite. The same one from the dream. My mother gave it to me recently, a relic from when I lived there. I studied it, assessing her claim that it belonged to me once. I had no memory of it. I have few memories of those times, except the emotions that resurface occasionally in my sleep.
