You meet me at a cafe. You put on your glasses carefully.

I ask you about the project you are trying to get off the ground. "Don't let me ramble," you say. 
Woman, I was at a party recently where someone talked at me for so long I felt like I was being brainwashed.

You ask me why I'm not interested in travelling. I say something performative about how I cycle through obsessions. Then I admit that I don't know how to do something good with my life. 

I'm holding a space for you 
like a mewing bird
cupped in my hands.

Go on, little one.
The runway is clear.

I'm not holding you.
Some deficiency in me is to blame for my kindness.
I love you and I will not help.

Your anger wells up like a sleeper wave and gets pissed all over the ground.
"Learn to be brave and content", I will never say to you.

If you do look back, don't tell me how many sets of footprints you see in the sand. 

If you could tell me what you wanted
I'd tear out the pages of the rulebook
and scribble obscenities in the margins.

Damn you. It fucking hurts
Do you remember tracing your ribs with my fingers?

and there you are 
blinking in and out of focus.

I'll sell my tongue to the lowest bidder,
redline our history,
then go and marry someone
that doesn't flicker 
so damn much.

There's nothing funny about my threats. You just laugh and say you're saving a place for me in your sky.

How the fuck do I love you.
I didn't mean what I said.
I was angry. Do you know how fucking hard this is?
I'm sorry. 

But all I've seen lately is people just passing through.
Is your retreating back how you choose to face me?
Because I'm not chasing a witch light into a morass.

Darling, it's in the quiet moments.
It's in the songs you play on repeat.
It's when you say something sarcastic just as your boss walks in.

If you believe I paid the price for your heart --

What? Then what?

Your subtlety isn't what I wanted.
I wanted to get smothered in compassion. I needed someone to fuck me up with gentleness. 

I told her I was looking for something co-dependent. But it's all meted out.

My love, do you remember that perfect week where everything went your way. You felt like you were on holiday all the while at home. Strangers brought you gifts, you ate beautiful food. And you had no fear.
