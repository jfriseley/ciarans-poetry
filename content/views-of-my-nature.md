I am stranded between two views of my nature. The desire to connect is human. It arises from a deficiency in me. 

I’m scared that when you name something it dies, that I was made to love freely, but return always to myself, always in a state of letting go.

I don’t want to exist at the critical point between attachment and freedom. Why do so many things in life evade being described? The source code is like writing in a dream, as you focus on it, writhing out of view.

I’m furious with God. I love you. You can’t hold my fucking hand.

Shh. An ocean of peace parts around you. My voice hits the sweet spot as I sing, resonating like sunlight through running water. I am distracted at work by the urge to make someone laugh. It’s me versus my cat and her rightful place on my laptop’s keyboard.

You were made to feel certain that you are loved. Has all the pain you have ever felt arisen from it?
