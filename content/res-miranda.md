Two theories were presented to me about a life well lived. The first to win. The second to enjoy every moment, humbled by the belief that you are no better or worse than any other.

I have tended towards the latter. My obnoxious yearning for egalitarianism - well, no one has talked me out of it yet. I crashed out of places where people compete to be the best, wrote them off as egotistical and pointless and divorced from the greater good and sought solace in environments with less pressure. In spite of what was drilled into me.

It’s in the quieter moments for me. The achingly beautiful relativity of aptitude and complexity and talent. The least capable person, the frailest person sitting opposite me on the bus, still a whole fucking universe. Still the most unlikely thing in a room full of discarded mess.

Lately I have been having some doubts. I’ve been dreaming of a quiet life, dreaming of my retirement to the heaven of food and coffee and loved ones and music, not ambitious, playing the game just enough to get by. And, much like at work, when trying to choose between two options, I listen to the little voice telling me there might be something that I missed.

Of late I have discovered that some of my friendships were not what I had hoped. That there was less trust in the bank than I thought. Do I move on from people because they have failed me or because I no longer feel I have an audience? The minute I sense hostility - not anger, but the curious rage of someone who cannot or will not listen to what I am saying - I leave. Walk away. No contest.

I never really want to block people. I tell them they don’t have to be a stranger and wish them well. 

I wanted to sit with people on the beach as we sifted through the shells. 

The fear that I haven’t taken things as far as I could - well, I listen to my fear, but it’s not a great basis for making plans. I listen to the fear that I never left my hometown.

Fear is a little message. But it’s not a compass. I can’t piece a life well lived together from fear.

Someone told me that the idea is to win the game and hand in your scoresheet at the gates of paradise. But the god I believe in came down to suffer with regular people in the fucking dirt. To teach them. To rebuke them. To bypass all the bullshit in their heads with imagery and metaphors and pure, beautiful structure. I consider what my friend is telling me but I reject their assertion that it’s the whole picture and nothing has been left out or missed.

Here’s something I don’t object to.

My love, you always told me what you wanted and as much as I was able I gave it to you, because I love you and want you to be happy. You told me you wanted to be the best at something - so we did that. At everything you turned your hand to, you excelled. And I was proud of you and in you I was well pleased.

You changed your mind. It stopped bringing you joy. We changed course. Regrouped. You needed some time.

Again you were the best. Again I was fucking proud of you. You were a bit of an arrogant shithead at times and I would have drawn you into line but you were so good. And I was so proud.

You struggled for a while because it stopped making you happy again. I wished you would include me more. You were lost. Afraid. Of me. Because of what they told you about me. Because of the attitudes of people who claim to have a monopoly on the mandate of heaven on earth.

You surrendered - I didn’t need you to surrender. I have always listened to you when you told me who you are and what you want. But I picked you up anyway. You wanted me to teach you finally. You finally wanted my help.

And my love, you never had to topple the man-made hierarchies or rise to the top of them or defeat your enemies or fight every fucking battle or even really do as you were told. And you never had to fade into obscurity and raise a family and be meek. It never mattered to me how much you achieved in the eyes of the world, though I’m in your corner if you won it all. I look back on everything that we have done together and the story we have told. Because there are no bad stories. And the plot we wrote together was something special. “Res miranda” - you wonderful thing.
