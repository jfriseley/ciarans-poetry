What is privacy?

A life not shared. A lifetime spent gestating in the cool, dark waters.

A shield around you. This is my space. You can come in if you respect me.

A life of fear. A life of controlling the manner in which others react to you. 

Truth filtered through social structures, just enough intimacy, just enough realness, just enough secrecy and drama. 

A curated image. A reflection in a mirror frozen in time.

Holding your tongue sometimes. Letting the truth ring in your heart, do not share it, your demeanour reveals the joy inside you.

Desperately clawing at every shred of skin on your body until it accords with the vision of yourself that you have created, rejecting any view of you that does not uphold the dictates of your identity. 

A constantly evolving force, but internal - a tidal wave in a capsule, steam billowing out of vents and escaping through minor cracks.

A stasis. An aborted rebirth. A decision at a point in time, now in the past, now gone, irrelevant.
