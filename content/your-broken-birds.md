I blocked someone I met. The next morning I was a little confused by myself.

Like with all people I saw their good qualities immediately, met them in person and saw the gravity in their eyes, the fractals of our conversations, camaraderie shared in a moment, rooted in place while the earth spins around us.

I don’t hold anything they have told me against them. Again I found myself rooted in place listening to a busker on the mall, one of the evenings they were in a bad place.

I used to blame the sick for their illness. My suffering was moralised and used against me, it was a framework I deployed for a time, until the normalising violence applied to me started bursting out of me through the seam. I sobbed and begged for forgiveness, in terror considering a lifetime I might have spent as an instrument to my own pain.

She and I shared a diagnosis. I have been meaning to attend a support group.

I blocked her and as I remembered in the morning I felt the pangs. Remembered her eyes. 

It got back to me recently that her girlfriend is a 
“psycho”. Keys people’s cars and plots revenge. And who am I to dash a friendship over the sharp rocks of something like this getting back to me? 

In lean times it seems a bird will more readily abandon its nest. That nature is solving some optimisation problem always, trading the risk of suffering and pain off against a future reward.

I dream of a world in which we are all connected. In which platonic, unconditional love is the currency of every conversation, and every mouth sings the truth. 

And perhaps, like the risk-mitigating bird, I thought that someone always on the fucking brink with poor judgement - even if the picture emerges from rumours - was too much of a threat to me. To the girl I have fallen in love with. To the friends I cherish. To the summery glow that settles on us during conversation or performance or song.

I do not think that the God I believe in abandons people. I think they were with me the times I came close to the edge, just there, witnessing me in the twilight, the little jumping off points I had that I may never have recovered from. And the feeling is immensely sad. After all, there is no lightning strike, no voices, no burning bush in these moments, just the fear and meaningless pain of someone solving an optimisation problem and foreseeing a future with no rewards. 

It is not in my toolset to sit there, to witness these people anymore.

I think I escaped the twilight. By being honest with myself, eventually connecting what I feel inside to the world around me. And it took a few times and loved ones getting angry at me and flight from drama and conflict. My conviction to the truth has never failed me, I never regret the choice of courage.

Please forgive me for leading with this example now instead of sitting with your broken birds.
