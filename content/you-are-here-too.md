You cannot remove yourself from the act of loving someone. 

At the art exhibition we attended together I stood before the neon lights and wept.

You can’t leave someone better than you found them; you walk into each other one day and then you are changed. I am changed by the stillness of your presence. I am changed by your conviction. 

“You are here too”
